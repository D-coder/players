# A simple Music Player

(This was supposed to have more functions but unfortunately the harddrive it was in fell and stopped working so I had to Design it from scratch just few hours before submission)

The Music Player uses main.js which has a playSong function which load as soon as the page is loaded. The player has following features.

* Big Album Art
* Play/Pause using click or spacebar
* Seekbar to play song from a specific time

## playSong

function playSong(){.         //function that handles events to play song
    song.src = music_name;    //song source which is defined already in the variable music_name
